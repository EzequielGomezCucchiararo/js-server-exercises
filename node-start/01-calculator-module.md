# Calculator Node

Create a `app.js` that `require` another file called `calculator.js`
When we call `node app.js` we should show in the console the following:

    The sum of 3 & 7 is: 10
    The multiplication of 3 & 7 is: 21

`app.js` should only show in the console the result of calling the functions `sum` & `multiplication`

These methods should be defined (and exported) in `calculator.js`

## Phase 2

Create a folder called `operations` and create in every folder a file exporting every operation needed in the main `app.js` file

    app.js
    operations/
        sum.js
        multiplication.js
        substraction.js
        division.js

## Phase 3

Install the module `moment` and use it to show the current time in this way:

    Today is : Monday, October 31st 2016, 10:08:34 am
    The sum of 3 & 7 is: 10
    The multiplication of 3 & 7 is: 21
